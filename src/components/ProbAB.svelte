  <h1 style="margin-top: 50px;">P(A âˆ© B): Probability of A and B</h1>

  <p>
    As we can see below, the outcomes A and B have an overlapping section. In
    this overlapping section both outcomes A and B simutenously occur. For
    example if we were rolling a dice the outcome that the number is less than 3
    and even have an overlapping section (the number 2).
